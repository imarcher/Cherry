# Real Data

We also have two real datasets:

1. [TEXMEX](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/): contains 1 billion SIFT feature vectors of size 128 representing images.

2. [Deep](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/noimi): contains 1 billion vectors, each of size 96, extracted from the last few layers of a convolutional neural network. 

We perform Z-normalization on both.

# Synthetic data

The script for generating random numbers is `cdata`. 
It adds a new number drawn from a Gaussian distribution N(0,1) to the value of the last number at each time point.

## Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04 \
GCC 9.4.0 \
GSL 2.7

## Compile and Run
It is Cmake project, which can be easily compiled and run by Clion.
Alternatively, you can compile and run using the following command.
```shell
# Move to the cdata folder
# Compile
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && cmake --build .

# Run
./cdata
./cdata_query
```

`main.cpp` is used to generate data, `main_query.cpp` is used to generate queries.
The first 70% of the data generated by `main_query.cpp` is the same as that generated by `main.cpp`, while the last 30% is the data generated by another seed.

The parameter settings are all in the main function.

After generating, move `ts.bin` and `query.bin` to the `inputPath` and `queryFilePath`  to run Cherry.
